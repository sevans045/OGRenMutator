# OGRenMutator
A mutator package for Renegade-X that is designed to replicate the gameplay and feel of original Renegade.

## Changelist

Here we will list all of the changes we intend to make via this mutator.
* Balancing: nerf infantry a bit, nerf flame tanks, make arties slower (or remove shift all together) , etc...
* Lock the MRLS turret from turning. It used to be very helpful around corners and hill.
* Remove refill timeout
* Remove obelisk's long charge. When it stops sounding "randy, know wot I mean?" it wouldn't hold a charge anymore and doesn't insta-zap the player.
* Remove inaccuracy from shooting off the hip, and shorten the scope distance. Right now close combat with a sniper rifle is quite hard.
* Remove emp, smoke, nades, airstrikes, and other mechanics that weren't present in old games
